Moved over the requirements from our project proposal so we don't need to keep pulling it up to check what stuff we needed

# Description:
Our own spin on the classic arcade game “Frogger” as an app for entertainment purposes. We chose Frogger because it should be able to translate well into an app, as it has fairly simple controls.

# Main Features:
* Have a moveable character
* Create obstacles to dodge
* Create levels with either increased obstacles and/or more map to traverse
* Tracks amount of time each level takes.
* Leaderboards to see who did best using a database.


# Stretch Goals:
If you have any stretch goals (features to be added or enhanced after the project development is completed) list them here in the same format as the main features section.

* Unlimited scrolling mode ( go for the record )
* Have better graphics
* Power ups (adding things like making the frog invincible for a couple jumps)

# suggested
goals suggested by prof to improve the project even more
* sound
